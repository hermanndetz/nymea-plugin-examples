    you need for building the connection to a device or service. Developing a new plugin provides you automatically with the
    full power of all nymea function like the RuleEngine, LogEngine and brings immeadiatly a client. You don't have to take care
    about the client management and any other functionality which should make the development straight forward and you can
    focus on your plugin and the features is should cover.
